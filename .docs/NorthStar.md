# **Core Streams**</br>*Modern Scalable Kafka Streams for the dotnet Ecosystem*
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

# **Objectives**</br>*5 Key design decisions driving implementation*

## **1. Completely dotnet approach to Kafka Streams**
    - Not a port
    - Topology built directly on atop Kafka
## **2. Cloud native architecture and Provider Agnostic**
    - Horizontally scalable
    - Kubernetes is home
    - Data can live anywhere
## **3. Stateful and Versioned by design**
    - Answers demand state and should not be an after thought
    - Change demands Versioning, evolution is key within the DNA
## **4. Transparent Parallelization**
    - Volume agnostic design
    - App awareness takes precedence over Operator tuning
## **5. Data Security by Default**
    - Zero Trust, Zero Exposure
